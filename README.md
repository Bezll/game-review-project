# Board-Game-review Backend Project

This project is the backend for the Herd App, our final team project carried out at Northcoders.
The Herd app is a gig finding application, that allows people to find live music events in their area, listen to the music, send reminders and chat with other participants

This project is the backend for the Board Game review site, a independent project carried out at Northcoders.
